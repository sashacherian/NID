    <h3>Decoding DataViz</h3>
    <h2>As a part of learning about DataViz and information design, each student chose an article to critique and learn from. I chose <a href="https://ig.ft.com/uber-game/">The Uber game</a> that was designed and developed by Financial Times and published on October 2017. </h2>

    <h2>What interested me the most was how FT uses a game to convey a message as most journalistic articles aim at directly answering questions about issue or topic. It was also published on a couple of websites like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" >Producthunt</a> <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/">Itsnicethat</a> and was also the winner of <a href="https://www.snd.org/bodd/about/2017-results/#ED">Society of News Design</a href="https://awards.journalists.org/entries/the-uber-game/">,<a href="https://seriousplayconf.com/2018-award-winners/">Intenational Serious Play Awards</a> and <a href="http://www.malofiejgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/M26-Awards-List-DEF.pdf">Malofiej International Infographics Awards</a>.</h2>
    

    <h2>I would like to clarify that I'm no expert I'm just learning a bit more about the field of dataviz by understanding thier audiences, constraints and the choices they made in the interactive article.</h2>

    


    <h2>The Uber game enables readers empathise with Uber drivers by making them select certain choices about work and personal life. The process of selection makes the reader feel that he's in control. The questions that the readers have to answer were collected through qualitative research study with Uber drivers. As the game is based on reality, the reader is able to feel the conflicts of the situation. Games tend to shrink the complexity of the subject, making it a subject one could get into quickly. The article doesn't cater to the facts of the situation. However, it makes the rules of the sysytem evident which helps a reader examine the system. There isnt a specific take away but it leaves an emotonal impact on the reader. </h2>

    <h2>It rich and heavy visual experience which reminds us of old school video games. The isometric illustrations with a bright colour pallete by <a href="http://cargocollective.com/rebeccaturnerdesign/Illustration">Rebbeca Turner</a> make the article approachable and attractive. It entices the reader to play it at the first view. However, as we go deep into the game, illustrations seem to get slighty repetitive. The viewers attention span is mainly on the changing questions, the increase of decrease in the money and change in time which is showcased on the top left. As a reader, I tend to ignore the  illustrations if it isnt apt the the question. At times, the beautifully illustrated buildings and the cityscape seem to over power the situation. But on a second thought, this might be just for me and someone who's new to the field of illustrations and visual arts might find it appealing and interesting. The illustrations tend to retain the feel of a old school video game.</h2>

   <h2>The screen above appears occasionally that gives the reader an understanding of the progress he's made overtime. The use of colour is apt and helps me focus on the information that I require to proceed. We see data represented along with an icon at most places. Visual encodings are fairly lesser in this interactive piece and the information has been presented in a straight forward manner to avoid too much of effort from the readers end in understanding the article.</h2>

   <h2>The narrative incoperates the reader by making them choose between personal commitments, work and other budgeting related questions. The story enfolds in a chronological order which are the events that occuer in an Uber driver's life. The story begins when the reader is asked to get into a role play where he has to imagine that he his a fulltime Uber driver with two kids to support and a $1000 mortage payment due in a week. There isn't a right or wrong choice in these questions which makes the reader to use himself as a measuring device. The use of interactivity to represent the changing numbers in time and money help the reader to navigate through the game.</h2>

   <h2>One might tend to lose interest due to the mutliple choice of questions and continous clicking as one goes through the story. One of the articles that capture the making of The Uber Game said that 70 percent of the players had finished the game which is typically higher than the engagement with interactive article on the web</h2>

   <h2>There isn't a direct peice of information that one can take away after going through the game about the situation of Uber drivers. What I liked about the game is how thet present my choices along with a comparison of what others did in percentages. Each readers experience and outcome would be different based on the choices made. The impact or the takeway from this peice might be hard to measure. However it tends to have an emotional impact on the reader.</h2>

   <h2>Use of sound can be a great way to help users get into the situation. Maybe I would try to reduce the illustrations by the middle and the end and focus the visuals more towards the questions and the interactions. A progress bar showcasing how many more such questions are left to answer might help some stay hooked to the game.</h2>


   <h2> This article was headed by <a href="https://robinkwong.com/">Robin Kwong</a>, Head of Digital Delivery at the Financial Times then. It consisted of a multi diverse team that included a data reporter who writes and codes (David Blood), a UX designer, an Illustrator (Rebecca Turner), a writer who codes(Leslie Hook), a data visualization journalist (Joanna S Kao) a newsroom developer(Ã†ndrew Rininsland).I tried sketching out the process the team might have followed to on this piece.</h2>
